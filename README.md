# Map-Painter
> A software for fixing adjacency issues and painting maps

This is a small project based on my other repository Map Processor (https://github.com/Shadow9876GitHub/Map-Processor) and is part of the ShadowChess modding tools

Please read the User Manual and if you have any problems with the application tell us about it in the Issues tab
